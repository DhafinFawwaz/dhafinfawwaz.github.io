        "description": "A really useful tool to animate UI in Unity Engine. It was born because i'm tired of writing and tweaking UI animations manually. With this tool, you can create UI animation easily with no code. You can simply drag and drop to create some smooth UI animation. There are some option that you can set such as the easing, duration, etc. You can also see the preview, drag the progress bar and also see the progress bar of each individual sequence. You can also make a custom sequence for non UI component with UnityEvent including the dynamic one. Adding function to call at certain time or at the end of animation is also possible with code. Features:\n- Sequence for Animating values of RectTransform, Image, Camera, CanvasGroup, Transform, and Dynamic UnityEvent.\n- Sequence for instant method such as Set Active All Input, Play SFX, Wait before executing next \n- sequence, Set Active GameObject, Loading scene, and UnityEvent\n- Preview animation in edit mode with Progress bar both globally and in each sequence.\n- Reorderable sequences.\n- Addable function to call at the end of animation or at certain determined time.\n- Public variables for every sequence.\n- Custom ButtonUI as bonus.\n- Demo.\n- Others.",

All of it is made with shader.\n- With only 1 texture, 1 material, 1 shader (which are the requirement to make rendering with 1 batch possible)\nThe main problem in optimizing a game is mostly about rendering. Of course, you can make all of this with the default sprite shader that already exist in the engine, and make those animation individually with a C# component. This will still make it rendered in 1 batch since it uses only 1 shader and 1 material which is the default one that comes with the engine. But imagine thousands of Monobehaviour.Update() running from those thousands of instance of C# component. It's overkill. That's why we can use shader. But if we use shader, all of those coins will do it's animation simultaneously like a military march. With the shader in this project, all of those variation is made possible but with a drawback which makes tinting the sprite is not possible anymore. But this won't affect anything since we almost never need to tint a rendered sprite. This is not the only trick. Getting the decimal of Time.time, custom parabole function instead of sine function, etc. are also things a few of many tricks that makes all the above possible.",
